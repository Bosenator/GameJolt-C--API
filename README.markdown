## GameJolt C# API
A wrapper for the GameJolt API service. Written, so *you* don't have to.

## Features
* Lightweight and self inclusive; no nasty dependencies
* Powerful; it does what it needs to, the way it should
* Extendable; use our netcode or json decoders if you need to
* Straightforward; hopefully it's documentated well enough you shouldn't need to ask
