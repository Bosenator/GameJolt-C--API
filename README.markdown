## GameJolt C# API
A wrapper for the GameJolt API service for .NET programs in C#.

## Requirements
* .NET 3.5 

*If you wish to build the source, we used VS10 for reference*

## Features
* Lightweight and self inclusive; no nasty dependencies
* Powerful; it does what it needs to, the way it should
* Extendable; use our netcode or json decoders if you need to
* Straight forward; hopefully it's documentated well enough you shouldn't need to ask
